# I Miss My Friends frontend

A simple Sveltekit frontend for I Miss My Friends.

## How to run

Currently there are no releases or set deployment method, so clone the repository, build the frontend and run it in preview mode.
NB! This is not for production, just a temporary way to have a process running for a little while.

After cloning the repository, bavigate to the frontend folder.
Run the following command to install necessary project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then build the frontend.

```bash
npm run build.
```

Lastly we run it in preview mode.

```bash
npm run preview
```
